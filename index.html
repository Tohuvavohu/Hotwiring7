                <p>This will be a WORKshop. Each day will have a mixture of talks, hack sessions, code demos, and brainstorming new instruments and systems. The three main science pillars will be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enabling GW astronomy</li>
                    <li>Rubin and the deep time-domain optical sky</li>
                    <li>The Radio transient revolution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sessions will focus on themes that span all three communities including challenges for effective follow-up, how to turn the coming flood of observations into scientific inference at scale, and the path towards the next generation of facilities. We will focus on software AND hardware infrastructure. In addition, any attendee can suggest other topics for discussion during daily unconference sessions.</p>
